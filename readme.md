# Django Custom User API

The Djangoâ€™s built-in authentication system is great but to build a real-world project, the official [Django documentation](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.1/topics/auth/customizing/) highly recommends using a custom user model instead. Commonly we want to store a few more data related to our User and authenticate using social media.
it's recommended to always use a custom user model for all new Django projects even if you don't need to add any custom user fields in the beginning.
